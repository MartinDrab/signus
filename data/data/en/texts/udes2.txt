#> Perseus Beta is an analogue of its smaller brother Alfa. But it is newer and more able to strike. It
 is equipped with a middle-class machine-gun U66 and its armour is rather thick.
#> Because of the thick armour, shorter range and rather high resistance is Beta able to pass
 through a bigger damage. It is used as a war tank in the first line (especially in the missions where
 heavy-weight machines cannot be transported) but it is also very effective when destroying smaller
 centres of resistance (the bombarding towers etc.) or protecting own buildings (stocks, basis, etc.).
#> Report for the commanders: "The news that our agents have stolen the tracings of Consortium's
 tank are completely undergrounded. The Propagators of this piece of news will be considered
 traitors and they should be punished according to this fact."
