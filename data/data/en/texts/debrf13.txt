#> According to the command we have embarked on the troopship and performed an attack
 on Ternulon. Despite certain casualties we have succeeded to gain control of Ternulon and
 several islands around it. The enemy tried to use the artefact against us, but except for some
 exceptions the crew acted according to the instructions. Base Sataran was captured and the
 artefact is on board of a plane heading towards Tankred.
#> We are still forced to stay on the islands - the inexplicable earthquakes#001 have raged the sea
 so much that it is more than risky to set sail...
