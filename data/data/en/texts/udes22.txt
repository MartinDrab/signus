#> Minotaurus is a defence tower armed with a long-distance shooting machine-gun that uses the
 explosive ammunition. The armour is made of material similar to the material used on the middle-class
 tanks Perseus Beta.
#> This unit is used mainly to guard important teritories and scientific basis. It is a gun with
 extraordinary long range and view which endanger the enemy surface units. The Achilles heel of
 Minotaurus is its small resistance (considering it is a tower). On the contrary its main advantage is
 the explosive ammunition which allows it to hit more units with only one shot.
#> During the training we noticed some cases when one Minotaurus has stopped the whole enemy
 army. But there were also cases when one helicopter has stopped the whole army of
 Minotauruses.
