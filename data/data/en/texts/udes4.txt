#> Dirrac is a sonic tank developed on the grounding of original Arconian technology. It
 is equipped with a sonic gun, that uses the ultrasonic principle. Dirrac's armour is rather
 thick.
#> It is actually a light-weight tank. Its high mobility together with the striking power
 enables to use this weapon against enemy long-distance shooting guns from the depth of
 own rear. Another advantage of this weapon is its massive front plate, which equals this
 weapon to much bigger tanks Perseus Gamma. On the contrary, the biggest weakness of
 Dirrac is its insufficient armour on the upper part, which makes it very vulnerable to the
 rocket weapons.
#> This weapon has, thanks to its not completely understood technology, an influence on
 the crews psychic. That is why the pilots are being chosen from the psychically most
 resistant individuals. Therefore it is possible to recognise a Dirrac pilot easily because of
 yellowish irises.
