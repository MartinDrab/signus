#> Corporation Ghytu has a monopoly for production and operation of repair shops of
 the Derken-Hamit type, which serves only to the ground units of Signus corps. This
 corporation is considered strictly neutral and therefore it serves to Toricon as well as to
 Consortium. There is an agreement about payments for using the repair service, which
 prevent mass usage of the repair service offered by this corporation. The repair service
 prices are confidential and they are communicated to the officers from captain above.
#> Shooting on these bases is strictly forbidden to all units. Such order could be given
 only by the officer in command - captain, from whose funds the losses of the Ghytu
 corporation would be then recovered.
#> The message from the chief commander: "The neutrality agreement does not prevent
 these units from occupation!"
