#> The HQ of the surface units ten miles to the east from the Trufat fort
#> Several hours ago, Consortium has tried to break through the northern continental
 blockade. That is the reason why the promised reinforcements haven't arrived yet. In the
 mean time, the enemy has gathered its surface units eight miles from its central fort -
 Trufat. According to the latest reports, there are numerous columns with food coming from
 northern Rotenalia to help Consortium. If they succeed to contact the units that are
 defending the base, the fights may last at least for several months. While trying to get the
 time needed to move the mentioned forces towards Trufat, the enemy has chosen conflict of
 armies on an opened field. Toricon doesn't have any other choice but to accept this
 challenge, because the gathered enemy units are intercepting us and we cannot move
 inland.
#> Your task is to decree this - let's say general - battle on our behalf. We cannot prevent the
 arrival of the reinforcements to the fort, but if we loose in this on-coming battle, Toricon
 can forget about investing Trufat for a long time, or forever...
