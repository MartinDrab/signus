#> The reinforcemnts from the Tetron base have arrived during the battle - reacting to a SOS signal
 we sent out to Consortium before the attack started. With their help we succeeded to fend off the
 offensive units. In the mean time we removed the casualties and treated wounded soldiers.
 According to our sentries the same thing was happening on the enemy side who is now returning
 back to Tortugal.
#> During the return to the base I have found a diary#001 of#001 one#001 of#001 the#001 dead#001 soldiers#001
 There are some things to be understand about the psychic of the garrison.
