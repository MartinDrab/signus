#> Each Airport consists from a radar tower, hangars and take-off and landing runways.
 The radar tower is also the command centre. Tower is the resident of the airport officer,
 who directly reports to the captain, as well as navigators who communicate with the combat
 aircraft in the air through transmitters. However each of these bases is fully automated and
 can work even without human control (usually when the airport is occupied). Hangars are
 also fully automated, similarly to the radar towers, and can work without human influence.
 Each of them is equipped with a service unit, able of partial repair of damaged machines.
#> Landing runways of the Signus corps are equipped with automated navigation system,
 which ensures lowering of the landing gears and exact run onto specified course, which
 allows for simultaneous landing of several machines.
