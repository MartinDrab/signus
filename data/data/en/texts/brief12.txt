#> Rufinon base
#> We have finally obtained some news about the missing troopship#001 Queen#001.
#> The ship that we have been expecting for one day and a half already, has been captured 15
 miles from the Retan Bay and shortly after this event it has been scuttled toghether with the
 enemy vessel.
#> On our request, Toricon has already launched an alternate ship for the artefact kept in
 Rufion. However, considering the hurricane raging in the sea, we cannot determine at what
 time will Artemis arrive.
#> The situation is even worse. Right after the mentioned conflict, Consortium started an
 action by the eastern coast of Koner bay...
#> Several numerous detachments are approaching us in the mean time. The aim of their
 attack is probably to get the artefacts.
#> Rufinon has sent out an SOS signal to thecircumjacent bases. Until now we have only
 received answer from Ardenor - it is offering us help. For several seconds we succeeded to
 contact Toricon's HQ. Accordingly to their command we should try to do the impossible -
 to be exact: we have received a command to wait until the arrival of reinforcements and
 then move - with the artefacts - to the port where a ship will be ready for us.
 I do not think I have to mention that we do not have big chance without the reinforcements
 to cover our back. Let's hope they will be here in time.
 #p.anamorf.320.184.
#> PRIMARY AIM: to keep the base until the arrival of reinforcements and than  perform the
 transport of the artefacts to the harboured ship.
