#> Dock is name for a joint port and ship repair dock which is used by marine of the
 Signus corps. Each of the Docks have its controlling tower which also serves as a lighthouse.
 Here is a residence of the officer - commander, who directly reports to the captain.
#> Similarly to all buildings the Docks have its Seal and it is fully automated. This allows for
 simultaneous repair of several ships. Docks are also equipped with a sophisticated radar
 system which can identify enemy's units on a relatively long distance. Unfortunately
 submarines cannot be identified by the radar system, that's why destroyers can be often
 seen keeping guard over the port. Docks, similarly to other buildings, are not armed with
 any weapon system and they must rely on protection of defence towers and mobile combat
 units.
