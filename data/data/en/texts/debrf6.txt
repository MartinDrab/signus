#> Testing of Goliash - liquidation of Amenur has happened according to the command. Right after
 explosion Consortium suddenly dropped off the elite units. They probably have a spy in our units.
#> According to our reporters the attack of Consortium in the territories of Sotona, Lebrukon, Dalia
 and Hedar has happened in the same time. In the mean time there is a direct conflict between
 Consortium's and Toricon's units.
#> Consortium is trying to get the public on it's side. As a reason to attack Toricon, they are using
 our attack action and liquidation of Amenur where most inhabitants were sympathising with
 Consortium.
