#> Strange phenomena that occur daily on all the continents of Arconis have caused various
 reactions in the world. What is the matter? What do those apparently harmless steams
 rising from the ground mean? And the frequent earthquakes, gigantic waves able to smash
 even the big tankers as if they were just small boats...
#> The scientists have locked themselves in their cabinets, the corporations are silent...
#> The panic-stricken citizens are willing to accept any explanation. The old inhabitants are
 recalling the legends, that were almost erased by time. And the myths which say that there
 was an old deity on Arconis before mankind came there. The gods were too proud to share
 this world and that is why it came to a long and destructive war, after which the gods had
 to step back. They had hidden to inaccessible depth of Arconis and had fallen asleep
 eternally. Does the vibrating earth with those steams signify the breath of the waking up
 gods? Are they waking up for revenge?
#> People talk about the end of the world. Many people have theories that the shakes are
 activated by the civilisation of Arcon which was defeated once and was staying hidden after
 the conflict with mankind to understand the acting of human race. And now this civilisation
 is trying to call attention to itself.
#> And nobody knows why.
