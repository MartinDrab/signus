#> Medea is an engineering unit. This machine does not have any armament systems and its armour is rather thin. The automated systems of these vehicles are directed from the friendly bases.
#> The biggest power of these vehicles is in their ability to create and repair bridges and railway tracks. During the creation of this unit, the constructors insisted on the saving of space for material. That is why Medea is (same as Gnome)
 fully automated factory on wheels controlled from the base.  Its general  weakness is the low resistance, which makes it very vulnerable when it gets under fire.
#> "When we come to kiss the Death, we will say: You are our Mother!" - Motto of Signus units.
