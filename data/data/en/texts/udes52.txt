#> Heliports are airports for aircraft with a vertical way of climb. Thus from the all
 mobile units they serve for the combat helicopters Rex and the fighter-bombers of the
 artefact generation - Mystic. All the Heliports are equipped with a navigation system
 similar to the one of airports, fully automated hangar and with a protection system called
 Seal, with which are equipped all buildings  (the only exception are repair shops). They are
 also equipped with a powerful radar system, which is not much effective than airport radar
 system. But it serves well especially to the mobile units. One of the weaknesses of this
 building is its relatively thin front armour, which is vulnerable to target shooting of longer
 duration.
