#> After comparing of the degree of vibrations in the desert area  - the forbidden Zone in
 Eutania, we have determined a place that should be above the focus of the earthquake.
 There was a whole complex of some mushroom shaped constructions found by the research
 expedition. And in the centre of this "City" was an old Arconian pyramid almost untouched
 by time. The ground around the city shakes in regular intervals and a strange sound is to be
 heard around. Shortly after the erection of the encampment of Prof. Lambert has taken
 over the leadership of the research. Thanks to him we have discovered the source of that
 strange sound and the cause of that chilli feeling we could not get rid of.
#> Those strange buildings are being shivered by the vibrations and they create the singing
 sound. This singing is accompanied by the tones from an immense depth that are not heard
 but they have certain influence on the human subconscious. The main aim of this scientific
 expedition is to find the access to the inside of the pyramid and to reveal its real
 significance.
