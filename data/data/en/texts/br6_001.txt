#> Because the territory we are looking for is supposed to be as large as an average village, it could
 be found in a quite unsettled area far away from the medias. I suggest the village Amenur in the
 northern part of desert territory Rotenalie.
#> Except of the advantageous position there is another reason for us to eliminate Amenur and all itïs
 inhabitants...
#> We already know that Amenur is a centre of a sect that venerates the old civilisation of Arconis.
 Several weeks ago, this sect has turned against Toricon and has accused it from the dishonouring
 of the mentioned civilisation.
#> They meant especially the research we are doing on artefacts, about which they have found out
 only by chance. This means that somebody from this group has witnessed disengagement of the
 artefact from the wrecks or another similar action. There is a possibility that a member of this
 group in one of our units.
#> If this information gets to the press, the name of Toricon will get disgraced. And that is something
 that we cannot afford, considering the importance of this research. It is very important to keep the
 action Goliath top secret. Because the elimination of Amenur could become a disguise for
 Consortium to send  the public against Toricon...
