#> Ceres - the conveyor of fuel - is equipped with huge fuel tanks with the multi-purpose fuel. This
 unit is not armed at all and it only has some basic armour.
#> This unit has been developed after it became completely imposible to send the war machines
 back to the basis after each mission without leting the enemy capture back his lost positions. The
 result of the hurry with which this unit has been constructed is its insufficient resistance. That is
 why it has to operate in the rear and under the protection of the allied armies. It is dangerous to
 remain close Ceres units because when it is destroyed, its explosion could seriously damage other
 units.
