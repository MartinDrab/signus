 #p.anamorf.320.184.
#> Three months ago the investigative group with Prof. G. Londown in charge has found an
 extraordinary artefact in the southern part of forbidden area in Sotona. Firstly none of us
 could guess how to get to its essence; all the tests and other experiments to reveal any
 special abilities failed. We have delayed our apparently trifling discovery and returned to
 the running research of an older Pegas type artefact. However no activity of the artefact
 was noticed. It's influence on the gravity seems to disappear. The same problem was also
 detected on other artefacts brought to the lab. Only accidentaly we revealed the fact that
 the artefacts stop working in the presence of Prof. Londown's artefact.
#> Unfortunately, our lab is not equipped enough to do such kind of research. The HQ of the
 research section have released a command to transport Lord to the fort Trufat, which is, at
 the same time, being our scientific base.
