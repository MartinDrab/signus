#> A movement of the army units of Consortium was registered near our base Ardenor, where the
 research of the artefact Taron is done. This area will be completely isolated in a couple of hours.
#> (See Dr. Iceberg's report#001 for details)
#> We were successful to find the cause of the sudden attack of Consortium: one hour ago the guards
 have captured Doctor B. Lex when he was trying to escape to the offensive army. After a
 consequential questioning B. Lex has told us about his connection to the enemy and about his
 research on Taron for Consortium, which is interested in the artefact's influence on the human
 psychic. New circumstances made the Toricon company to draw up an order which says that we
 shall stop the offenders from getting the artefact and perform the prepared shift to make further
 research IMMEDIATELY. It is necessary to loose the Consortium's attention and drift Taron into
 our base Tankred at the North from Ardenor, where our position is stable. Doctor Iceberg will be
 in the charge of the action.
