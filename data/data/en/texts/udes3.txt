#> Perseus Gamma is a war tank determined for the fight in first line. It is equipped with
 a heavy doubled gun and an anti-aircraft machine-gun Grund. Its armour is very thick.
#> These units are brought to bear especially for their big destructive power and
 considerable resistance. Another big advantage of this gun is its anti-aircraft machine-gun
 that together with another advantages enables to operate even separately in the rear of the
 enemy. The only weakness of this battle colossus is its small mobility which makes it an easy
 target for the long-distance shooting weapons and towers of enemy.
#> "The difference between getting tumbled down in Beta or Gamma is that you are
 dying with a wonderful feeling that they had to waste much more ammunition" - writing on
 the Perseus Beta's garages.
