#> Oasa is a troopship.
#> It does not have any weapon systems and its armour is not very thick.
#> It is absolutely impossible to engage this unit to the direct militant actions. On the
 contrary - it has to be constantly under the protection of warships. It is very dangerous to
 remain near Oasa for another, because when Oasa gets hit, the following explosion can
 damage the ships around badly.
#> The atmosphere in Oasa does not remind us of any calm and quiet mood, that
 someone ignorant of the war atmosphere of Signus units could imagine.
