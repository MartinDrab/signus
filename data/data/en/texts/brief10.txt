#> We have just succeeded to catch the SOS sent by the Toricon's base Oberun.
#> The strike units of the Consortium have apparently undertaken a lightning speed operation
 during which they succeeded to occupy the only access to Oberun - The Torvill Defile.
 When they gained the control over the defile, another of their army units have gotten
 through it. The recieved signal was very weak and it is supposed that the base will be
 captured in any second...
#> According to the oath, the help to the friendly base is our duty and that is why I am
 ordering the attack the Trovill.
#> It is necessary to pierce through the defile and lure part of the enemy units away from the
 base and to eliminate the besiegers with our conjunctive forces. But there is one problem -
 they will be expecting attack. The defile is very well equipped against the military attack.
#> Prepare for presence of mines, shooting towers etc.
