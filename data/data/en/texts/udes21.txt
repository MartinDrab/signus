#> Pagoda is a defence tower armed with a machine-gun gauge 138mm with a middle range. It is
 well armoured. Owing to the high resistance it can bear a considerable damage.
#> The biggest weakness of this weapon is its short range, that makes it defenceless against the
 long-distance shooting weapons and it allows the mobile units to get away form its range.
#>"! And millions of hearts will fly to You, oh Lord! And Thy gate will send out a heavenly army
 to save the white shine hidden in a sacred pagoda...." - part of a modern sutra of prophet Amhal.
