#> Volunteers made an offer to carry out the action, that has a life importance to Toricon.
 However, participating means certain death....
#> The research division has localized the artefact#001 (captured by Consortium). This artefact
 has an incredible destructive power, and if it is controlled by a specialist it is able to cancel
 the effect of our weapons. Even the ones that were developed on bases of artefact
 technologies. Consortium is transfering this artefact from Sotona to the fort Trufat in the
 mid-Lystonie. We are not able to capture this fort, at least not this time. That is why we
 have to attack the escort unit of artefact right after they cross of the ice-zone of Sotona's
 border.
#> According to the patrols we sent out, the colon is very well armed but our chances to get the
 artefact are much better in open terrain than it would be in front of Trufat's fortress.
 Your only task is to get the artefact from the enemy's occupation even if it should be
 destroyed. The explosion of this artefact means the end of all the life in several tens of
 meters. That is why it is for your sake to be as successful as possible. If you die in this
 action, remember, it was for a good purpose.
