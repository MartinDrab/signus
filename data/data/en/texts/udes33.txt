#> Poseidon is a heavy cruiser. It is equipped with heavy-weight gun, four torpedoes and
 an anti-aircraft gun. Its armour is rather thick and it has an excellent monitoring system
 Akai.
#> These ships are analogical to heavy tanks. Even considering the range, Poseidons are
 beyond controversy much better.  They are one of the most overwhelming units ever and
 together with accompanying unions of Vikings they are creating the spin of Torion´s navy
 forces. Their biggest weakness is the vulnerability to enemy's submarine attacks without
 protection of the destroyers.
#> Kliatron, the predecessor of Poseidon was originally a light-weight cruiser. Although
 in this form did not respond to the demands that are being put on Signus units. That is why
 the light-weight gun was replaced With much more overriding Drak.
