#> Artefact PEGAS
 #p.anamorf.320.184.
#> Yesterday we succeeded in revealing the exceptionality of the artefact that was found several miles
 from Sanukor. We have already had special feelings before. But now we are finally able to use this
 strange phenomenon on higher level.
#> Professor R. Generson has performed several tests with the ammunition shots under the influence
 of artefact Pegas. After the computation of the aberration from the straight course of the missile
 our supposition was confirmed. No aberration means that Pegas must have an influence on the
 gravity and the inertia of the missile's movement.
#> We got the same results during the testing of guns with heavier gauge.
 The HQ of the Consortium are trying to use Pegas in military actions - for example for shooting
 on the Toricon bases on longer distance.

#> But that is still only a theory. The research is still running under control of Prof. Generson.
