#> Perseus Alfa is developed on the bases of the standard army tank RT 29. It is equipped with a
 light-weight short-distance shooting recoilless gun. Its advantage is first of all its high mobility.
#> According to its comparatively low shooting power it is only supposed to be used in larger
 fighting forces. Thank to its high mobility it is possible to move the hit unions made of these units
 easily to strategically very advantageous positions. It also seems to be quite advantageous to use
 these tanks for the elimination of the enemy long-distance shooting weapons placed deep in the
 rear.
#> It is historically the first weapon prepared for the use of the Signus units. The constructors warn
 of the defects especially in the thin armour. That is one of the reasons to suggest its partly
 substitution with units of a different type.
