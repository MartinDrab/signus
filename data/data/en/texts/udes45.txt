#> Satan is a self-destructive highly explosive mine, based on the Arkonian technology.
 There are incorporated gravitation sensors in its body, which allow free moving above the
 ground. Its main weapon is its self destruction. It is further armed with a mine-thrower for
 shooting down distant objects.
#> The major weakness of this artefact weapon is a low resistance which makes it
 vulnerable to any unit attack. On the other hand the biggest advantage of Satan is a
 gigantic explosive charge, which damages everything live and lifeless in the Perseus Beta
 range of shooting. Some high officers have also protested against creation of this weapon,
 however it turned out to be necessary to engage it.
