#> Viking is a destroyer. It is equipped with a mid-weight gun Ghecker, a light anti-
 aircraft gun and abyssal mines Aglovian.
#> The engagement of these units in actions is supposed only in bigger formations with
 the support of heavy ships or cruisers. It appeared necessary to engage them in convoys as
 supporting ships for the aircraft carriers Lagoons, where they function as an antiaircraft
 flank. Another big advantage of these ships is their radar system which enables us to see the
 enemy submarines and mines.
#> "Although Viking is rather weak as an individual, it is necessary for marine battles
 and sometimes could be very important." - the opinion of Admiral Gretzsky.
