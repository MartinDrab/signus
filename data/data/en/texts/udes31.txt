#> Flint is a cannon boat. It is equipped with a mid-weight recoil gun similar to the
 Perseus Beta tanks.
#> It is a unit of supportive shooting, partly able to replace the mid-weight tanks in
 terrain inaccessible for Perseus Beta tanks. They are one of the weakest navy units in
 formations called Signus and that is why their engagement to the marine battles is possible
 only in bigger militant formations and with support of heavy war ships.
#> These cannon boats were taken over from the navy fleet by Signus units. They got the
 name Signus after the colonel who has perished while, with his boats, guarding a bridge not
 to be crossed by three enemy battalions.
