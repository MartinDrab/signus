#> Welcome to the Tridi Vision war news.
#> Toricon has hit Consortium considerably.
#> This morning the gigantic corporation has started an attack on the positions of Consortim
 in southern and south-eastern Eutania. Bases Sanukor and Rufion,  captured by
 Consortium some time ago, are under complete control of the attacking side again. And the
 units of Toricon are moving to the inland successfully. Except this offence another marine
 battle was unleashed 15 miles from the south-western coast of Lystonie, where the fights are
 still raging. Listonia and the northern part of Rotenalia seem to be the only integrated areas
 of Arconis that are under complete control of Consortium. There are some local fights going
 on in the western part of Eutania, Misteral and Dalio.
#> The deserted soldiers are gathering in organised groups and they are terrorizing the
 citizens. And that appears to be a big problem. The bloodiest fights have taken place in
 Dalio today in the early afternoon. The incident has caused 15 casualties...
