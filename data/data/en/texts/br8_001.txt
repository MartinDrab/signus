#> Welcome again to the Tridi Vision news.
#> Shortly after six o'clock the Consortim has registered casualties again after a long time.
#> Toricon's hit units have undertaken an attack on an important Consortium's military port
 in the western part of Hedar - Sotorat. From our reporters we know that it was actually the
 centre of Sotorat, where Consortium was trying to hide a gigantic factory for the
 production of various weapons.
#> Except for this factory the Consortium has other sources. For example the business contacts
 with the Artefix company, supplying planes to them. However this information is
 unsupported. In the case of Toricon we were not able to find its sources except for recently
 captured Sotorat.
#> See you soon with more Tridi Vision news.
