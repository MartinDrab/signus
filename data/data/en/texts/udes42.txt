#> Caesar is a conveyor plane. It is powered by two engines. It does not have any
 weapons and it has mid-class armour. It has two collapsible engines, that enable to start
 vertically.
#> Originally, Caesar was drawn up as a heavy-weight bomber, but no more bombers
 were needed after the creation of Saturns. That is why the planes were reconstructed and
 are used for  airborne units of Signus commandos. The engagement of Caesars in direct
 battles is limited by their low resistance. Therefore we recommend to use them only under
 the protection of Ikaroses and Mystics.
#> All the types of Caesar planes are under the tactical leadership of marine foot, and
 therefore there were some problems with their engagement in the strategic aircraft
 missions. In the mean time we can easily state, that there are no more problems among our
 units. - the report from the Defence Division to the Highest Presidium.
