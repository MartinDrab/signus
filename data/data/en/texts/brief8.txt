#> According to the tactics the defence division has chosen, the best defence is the attack. It is
 necessary to capture the port Sotorat. Our knowledge about the significance of Sotorat for
 the antagonist is following: not only military ships are harboured here, but also the
 troopships that are importing weapons and ammunition to the coastal area. This fact made
 us to draw a conclusion that there have to be huge reserves in Sotorat or a factory that
 produce these weapons. If we eliminate Sotorat, Consortium looses one of its main sources.
#> Of course it would be more advantageous for us to gain the control of Sotorat with as little
 damages as possible, but the HQ supposes that in case of the breach of their defence the
 units of Consortium have an order to detonate the whole port and to conduct the fights
 from their ships only.
#> The only possibility is to attack Sotorat from the continent. Your primary aim is to capture
 the docks, after wining the access to the river. Do not eliminate enemy ships, but capture
 them and use them to fight against the enemy.
