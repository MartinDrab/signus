#> We have disembarked along the coast of Penytras accordingly to the order and started the
 attack. During the operation we found out that the suppositions about the military situation
 on the island were false. We have met with their tough defence and now we have to face the
 attack of enemy who became superior. However thanks to the experience and abilities of the
 commando Signus, we succeeded to capture the island. Even though it was done with
 considerable casualties.
