#> The mission was successful.
#> Right after the units of Signus have penetrated into the base of Consortium, all the sectors were
 controled and Betas captured. Owing to a neglect, the only captured soldier escaped and probably
 sent an SOS message to the Consortium base. No reaction from the enemy was registered yet. In
 180 minutes we are expecting arrival of the army, that should keep this area out of the influence of
 Consortium.
