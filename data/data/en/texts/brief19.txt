#> The last centre of resistance of Consortium is the central fort on the south of Lystonia -
 Trufat. It is up to you to overcome the last obstacle to enthrone the peace. The result
 depends on the energy of your resolve and on your abilities. In the last couple of weeks the
 enemy has gathered his remaining forces, which are not small, in Trufat. Thanks to the
 unexpected circumstances we have lost the advantage of the superiority in numbers -
 relatively big part of military forces was sent to Dalio, Lebrukon and other areas to solve
 the problem of soldiers' bands definitely. Commando Signus that was accompanying the
 team of scientists in the zone of Eutania is not about to arrive either. The mentioned#001 team#001 is#001
 even#001 considered#001 missing#001.
#> Fortunately Consortium is not supposed to change its position considerably. Toricon is only
 interested in time - in the time that is dividing Arconis from the final peace...
