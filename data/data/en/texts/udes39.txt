#> Cobra is a light-weight assault bomber equipped with explosive bombs and a heavy-
 weight machine-gun for air duels. Its armour is rather thin.
#> The biggest advantage of these units is their easy manoeuvring together with their
 speed which enables to move them in one moment to endangered places. Their disadvantage
 is low resistance that enables their effective engagement only to bigger formations or
 together with Satruns. During the air duels, Cobras have to rely on the support of Ikaroses.
#> The HQ report: "The defamation that general Esencki died because he was not able to
 control the machine during the testing flight are absolutely groundless and are lowing the
 prestige of this man who should be an example for all of us. The circulators of this
 defamation can expect the court-martial punishment."
