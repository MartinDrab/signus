#> Messiah is a long-distance shooting gun on a train chassis. This gun is similar to the
 Goliath's but it doesn't use any artefact technologies.
#> The big advantage of this weapons is its long range and the destructiveness that
 convinces even Goliash. The biggest weaknesses are the limitations that result from
 Messiah's weight, which enables the transport only on a train chassis and limits its mobility
 on railway tracks. Another big weakness of Messiah is the thin armour, that unables the
 engagement of this machines to the front lines.
#> "...in the name of Messiah the blood will be shed and in His name, the thorns of kings
 and princes will crash down." - "Sibyl's divination" - found in the databases of colonising
 ships.
