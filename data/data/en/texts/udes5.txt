#> Agni is a light-weight laser tank of a similar design to the sonic tank Dirrac. It is
 armed with a laser gun and similarly to the "sonics" this weapon has relatively thick
 armour.
#> The application of Agni is nearly the same as of Dirrac. The only more significant
 difference between these two weapons is a little bit higher resistance of Agni. The major
 weakness of this weapon is probably its defencelessness against air-raids, which excludes the
 possibility of its individual engage without any support of air-raid protections.
#> " ...and the Lord of fire will come and strike Your bodies and souls with flame, He will
 chase You and He will not have any mercy with any of You when You will be weeping tears
 of fire and beg for forgiveness." - the eleventh verse of Klihiána Epic - describing the end of
 the world of the infidels.
