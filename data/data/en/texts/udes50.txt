#> The radars are drawn up to be similar to the bases but in a smaller scale. In every radar there is a
 operation cell where an executive sergeant-mechanic looks after the run of this fully automated
 unit. Except of this centre the radars also include receivers that are taking the information over to
 the monitors of allied units and allow us to use the moment of surprise and to attack the enemy
 first.
#> All the units are equipped with a protection attachment called Seal.
#> Radar is the only unit that is used in every army in absolutely equal form.
