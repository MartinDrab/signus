#> The aircraft carrier Imperi, 15 miles away from the coast of Lebrukon
#> Toricon  obtained message that Consortium is supposed to mobilize the forces in the areas
 of eastern Lebrukon to capture the forbidden territory of Lebaran. According to our bases
 Kytan and Setrix, the enemy has not tried to penetrate through the defence yet. But he may
 try anytime. For security reasons Toricon decided to eliminate all the bases of Consortium
 that are placed in the mentioned area. Considering the supposed extent of the destructive
 consequences of this mission, it is necessary to make sure that the mentioned reports are
 truthful. But Toricon cannot wait for such a long time. At present time, the aircraft carriers
 are needed along the coast of Losaba, where the Toricon's navy is trying to pierce through
 continental blockade lasting for several weeks already.
#> Your task is, first of all, to get in control of several airports around our zone, where our
 bombers could land. Immediately after the confirmation of the threat of the enemy
 expansion to the Toricon's areas, we will start to attack from the captured airports. Attack
 the bases in the area of eastern Lebrukon.
