#> The Experimental Centre, Tankred (three days before the Taluon action)
#> þ
#> Six weeks have already passed out since the first earthquakes on Arkonis. We have
 established the measuring equipment to all of the areas, where the vibrations are causing a
 strange sound detectable with the special gadgets only. We have found a similar sound
 created by one of the artefacts but we were not able to reveal its origin. Prof. Lottenbert has
 brought in a theory that there could be the old civilisation of Arconis beyond the origin of
 this strange sound, with frequency changing in certain repeating intervals. This civilisation
 was defeated by our ancestors in the battle for Arconis and it was considered dead until
 now. Lets admit that to destroy something or someone like this is not quite possible. Prof.
 Lottenbert has intervened with a thought according to which the old civilisation of Arconis
 might be trying to make a contact with the human race again.
#> According to the measurement data, the vibrations are strongest in the area of base Taluon
 in the Mid-Rotenalia. Unfortunately this area is under control of Consortium. That is why
 we are asking Toricon to support our project in which Prof. Lottenbert is about to employ
 himself with the effort to understand to the Ancient race.
