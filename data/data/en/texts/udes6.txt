#> Scorpion is a light rocker-launcher armed with four missiles for the bombardment of surface
 targets. It is equipped with a standard rocket holder Hackler which is also used by common army.
#> As the title hints, it is a gun determined for the destruction of the enemy units from the deep of
 the rear. The armour plates can hardly survive a direct shot from a tank but Scorpion is able to
 move quickly to strategically advantageous positions (and out of the range of the enemy units).
 The great weakness of this weapon is a small amount of rockets which makes bombing effective
 possible only with the support of ammunition conveyor Gnom.
#> It is a public secret that Scorpion was developed on the costs of Trakhal corporation which has
 gained the right to buy sixteen war helicopters Grazij as a reward for developing this weapon.
