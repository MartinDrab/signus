#> You have been chosen for this mission on the basis of your introductory psychological
 tests... The resistance against the effects of sound frequencies on the human brain is
 important. Against the artefact with code name Silence, to be exact. Several weeks ago, the
 scientist have agreed on the fact, that this artefact is so significant for Toricon, that it will
 be safer to continue the research in the Tankred lab. The corporation has sent a special
 helicopter for Silence, however the pilot and his crew were captured during the refilling on
 the northern coast of Lebaran. In the meantime, Silence is being kept in the base Sataran
 on one of the Wenill islands - on Trmulon. Your task is to capture this island and get the
 artefact from the enemy. If the Consortium tries to use the effects of this artefact, nothing
 should happen. The frequencies that this artefact is able to transmit do not have sufficient
 influence on certain individuals in order to control them.
#> The navy supplied us with cruisers and troopships, so the indemnity of access to the island
 is up to them. The rest is up to you.
 #p.anamorf.320.184.
#> PRIMARY AIM: Capture the island, where the base with the artefact is, and the other
 islands around it.
