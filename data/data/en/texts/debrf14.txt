#> We have been trying to keep the bridge until the arrival of the reinforcements, according to
 the command. We were successful but with considerable casualties. We have started the
 action against the base right after the arrival of the sonic tanks. Shortly after the
 breakthrough of the defensive barrage, our units have penetrated to Taluon. In the present
 time we are recreating the defensive barrage, because the sonic tanks are returning to
 Tulos. At the moment the helicopter with Prof. Lottenbert#001 lands, everything will be ready.
