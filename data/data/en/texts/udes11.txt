#> Boomerang is a light-weight vehicle of investigation with an excellent monitoring
 system. Its greatest weapon is its speed. The greatest weakness is the thin armour and low
 resistance.
#> These units were constructed to be able hold up to five-member commandos inside. These
 commandos enable these vehicles to capture the enemy buildings (radars, stocks and basis). For
 this quality the Boomerangs became very important strategic units. Another big advantage of
 Boomerangs is its monitoring system that enables to see the enemy to relatively considerable
 distance.
#> Boomerang was originally used as a light-weight war tank. But at present time Perseus Alfa has
 overtaken its tasks in the war missions.
