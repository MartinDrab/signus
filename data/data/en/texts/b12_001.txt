#> Report from investigators about the situation in the area of Eutania:
#> The troopship Queen which has been moving to the coast of southern Eutania to transport
 the artefacts kept in Rufion to Tankred, was captured by an enemy ship under the flag of
 Consortium during its sail.
#> There is a supposition that the enemy has planned to use its prey, which was not even able
 to send an SOS signal, to continue in the determined route and to get the artefact.
 Fortunately the route of both the ships was crossed by one of our submarines, that was
 checking this area. As soon as the captain understood the situation, he has informed his
 superiors. On Toricon's command, both ships were scuttled and a warship Artemis, that
 was harboured on the east from Kentaur base, was sent out for the artefacts.
#> Shortly after the ship sinked, Consortium has started an attack from the continent. For
 several weeks Consortium has been gathering its units in Koner bay secretly and now used
 the situation.
