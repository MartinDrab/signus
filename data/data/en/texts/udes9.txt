#> Goliath is a heavy-weight mobile long range gun using highly explosive ammunition
 based on the artefact technology. Its undercarriage and gun are made from a special alloy
 to be able to bear up against high temperatures which occur during a shoot. The Goliath
 combat limitations are nearly the same as those of the heavy rocket launcher Hercules. They
 cannot be used in the first line because they must be protected by tanks and air-raid
 protections. A big advantage of Goliath, compared to its older colleague Hercules, is its
 ammunition magazine which allows fire of longer duration without any support of
 ammunition conveyors - Gnomes.

 technicians, who have reached through their hard work this outstanding outcome and who
 have created the machine which bounds the majesty of our predecessors on Arconis with
 the inventiveness of human intellect."
