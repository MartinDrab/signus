#> After successful fending off of the Consortium's units the enemy is withdrawing from the area of
 Batix.
#> They are returning to Tortugal as they were supposed to.
#> Toricon is convinced that existence of any base out of the it's influence is inadmissible.
 According to the HQ it is most advantageous to use our superior forces and to attack
 Tortugal.
#> On the top of it, we found out about artefacts that could bring to Consortium the power to thread
 Toricon's positions.
#> That is why it is necessary to capture Tortugal and to get all the artefacts including the documents
 about the recent research.
 #p.anamorf.320.184.
#> PRIMARY AIM: To capture the Tortugal base.
