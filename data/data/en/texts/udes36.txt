#> Lagoon is an aircraft carrier. It is equipped with anti-aircraft machine-guns of gauge
 32mm. It does not have any weapon system and its armour is thin. But it is quite resistant.
 The strongest weapons of this these ships are their aircrafts. Lagoon is able to take on the
 board up to 5 heavy bombers Saturn and 12 interceptors Ikaros. The biggest weakness of
 these ships is insufficient armament. And that enables its engagement to the rear only and
 with support of accompanying destroyers.
#> "The engagement of these floating airports has appeared to be very advantageous,
 especially  in the duels with war ships Krakens" - the military bulletin.
