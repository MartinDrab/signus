#> Prof. Dietel's diary, fort Trufat
#> þ
#> It seems that the military luck has decided to stay with Toricon for now. The enemy
 attacked this morning and neither the coastal guards nor the system of the basis was able to
 stop him. Consortium is fighting hardly for every tiny part of the remaining area. Both
 sides seem to be equal right now. Toricon is moving towards the base slowly, but surely. If
 our navy succeeded to break through the continental blockade, there would be a chance to
 turn away the impending defeat. For several weeks already no ship importing food and
 provisions was discharged. Unless a miracle is to happen, our food endures maximally for 2
 more months. Everything is kind of absurd. A gigantic corporation with top equipment,
 enormous number of soldiers and with everything else possible, has no choice but to wait.
#> The units in northern Rotenalia are still a certain hope. If these units succeed to get some
 food from the citizens anyhow, and get to the fort with this food before Toricon invests us...
