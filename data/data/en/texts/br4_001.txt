#> We are trapped in here. The soldiers of Consortium are everywhere and
 they keep narrowing the circle around the base. It feels like there is a rope
 around my neck.
#> They are moving slowly but self-confidently like they knew the feelings they are bringing on us.
#> A couple of minutes ago we have lost the advanced fortification by the bridge.
 I have a terrible feeling that George Hastings, my cousin is on duty today. I will
 probably never see him again. Not alive.
#> The guys are beginning to be nervous. No wonder, we have never been in such a terrible situation.
#> If we could at least use the new guns that were tested here by Toricon. Without them  all of us are
 probably going to die.
#> The last chance for us is the arrival of reinforcements from Toricon. If Bronx hasn't just made
 them up.
