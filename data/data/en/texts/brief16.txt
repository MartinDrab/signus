#> Several hours ago the air investigation service has noticed some sinister activity of the
 Consortium in the area of Eutania. It is the attack on geologists that were practising a
 scientific research for Toricon. The swoop happened in the area of Mid-Eutania in the
 forbidden places, where the team of geologists with Prof. Lottenbert was engaged in the
 research of ancient Arconian#001 City#001. In the present situation this area is under complete
 control of Consortium. Toricon demands us to perform a return operation aimed at
 regaining of the occupied area in the shortest term possible. Toricon is afraid that
 Consortium could find new and much more destructive artefacts that were discovered until
 now and use them to turn the course of the war in their favour.
#> The action took place under the extreme conditions of dry desert and that is why you were
 chosen - the specialised Signus commando.
#> The main aim is to capture the city. But in any case it shouldn't be destroyed. Let me repeat
 this IT MUSTN'T BE DESTROYED! The faith of whole world will depend on its existence.
