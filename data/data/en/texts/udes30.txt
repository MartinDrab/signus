#> Ganymedes is a supporting train, some kind of combination of Ceres, Gnome and Iris
 on the tracks. It doesn't have any weapons and its armour is thin.
#> The constructors of this highly explosive unit warn: If Ganymedes gets destroyed it is
 necessary to rebuild the tracks and that is why we do not recommend to engage these trains
 in direct conflicts. Ganymedes can of course support even the non-train units. It appears to
 be safer to bombard Ganymedeses from the air and that is why we recommend to keep
 these trains under the flak protection of Falangas.
#> The Defence Division and the Highest Presidium were debating about the necessity of
 these machines for a long time. In the end, Ian Zening had his will.
