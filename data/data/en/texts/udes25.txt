#> Neptune is a conveyer hovercraft. It has been created according to the technology of
 Arconis civilisation. It does not have any weapon systems.
#> The biggest advantage of these machines is their ability to transport units across
 terrain, that surface units would come over with big problems or only with the help of
 engineering machines Medias. The weakness of Neptune is its low resistance when it gets
 under the fire. This fact unables to engage Neptunes without the support of long-distance
 shooting weapons.
#> "These units should be transferred to the civil sector after the triumphal ending of this
 conflict and replace the troopships. That should improve the public's attitude to the army."
 - an excerpt from report of the Defence Division to the Highest Presidium.
