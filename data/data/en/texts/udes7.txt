#> Hercules is a heavy-weight rocket-launcher equipped with a rocket holder Pluton. Pluton can
 carry up to six missiles and is able to fire them up to two miles of distance.
#> Faster and further development of this weapon was incited by many reports from higher officers
 whose units have met the shooting towers Minotauruses. A gun with a bigger gauge
 than this tower was requested. However this weapon is armoured insufficiently and it has a small
 amount of missiles. This fact makes it useful only to fire from the rear and
 with the support of Gnoms. The great advantage of Hercules are the fraction rockets that enable
 to hit a larger area with only one shot.
#> The report for the press: "The long-distance shooting rocket-launcher Hercules was on the order
 of the commander tested in a completely uninhabited stone desert Hilbog. Any other news in the
 media are spurious documents and should be of service to Consortium."
