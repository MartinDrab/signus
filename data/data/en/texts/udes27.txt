#> Olymp is a conveyor train. Its chassis is constructed to be able carry up to 130 tons of load
 without slowing down its speed.
#> During the development of this train all the other requirements became subordinated  to the
 endeavour for creation of a transport unit beeing able to carry the biggest load possible. This has
 influenced the speed of Olymp (it is only average) and the insufficient armour too. However it
 turned up to be a very useful assistant. Especially in the missions where a big amount of heavy-weight
 machines is needed to be transported to distant positions.
#> The crew of the control centres in the trains is recruited from the members of the White Wolves
 commandos known as the Suicide Commandos. These commandos assure that the trains wount
 get captured by the enemy units.
