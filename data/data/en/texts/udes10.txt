#> Patriot is a light-weight mobile long-distance shooting gun using the explosive ammunition of
 the same gauge as the middle-weight tanks (Perseus Beta). It has limited armour-plates and no
 short-distance shooting weapons.
#> This weapon is determined to shell the enemy units from the rear and therefore it is equipped
 with a long-distance shooting cannon placed on the chassis of Patriot 3K. However it has to pay
 with an unsatisfactory resistance for its mobility.
#> Patriot is one of the few units of Signus, that is also used by the standard army (but they call it
 KH-12C). The best known advocate of the KHs is general Esencki (one of the originators of the
 idea of the Signus units), who was during the tactical training of Toricon able to hold the ford
 across the river Astra only with the aid of the second and fourth armoured regiment of the third
 division mostly made of the KHs against three tank divisions with general Westen in charge.
