#> One of the important areas that are not under complete control of Toricon yet is island
 Penytras. The curiosity of this island is the fact, that though it has relatively comfortable
 climate, it is not inhabited by civilians. Consortium centres the research of artefact
 technologies, testing of recently developed weapons and the training of the hit units on this
 island.
#> Gaining of Penytras would be a great acquisition for Toricon. Special attention is dedicated
 to the laser tanks that are tested here in the present time which Toricon would like to add to
 the equipment of own surface units. Considering the fact that Consortium has to face the
 pressure in the areas of south-eastern Eutania#001, it is supposed that the most of the military
 forces will be centred out of the island. The corporation has decided to use the opportunity
 and to gain the control over Penytras.

#> From our spy on the Consortium's island we have received detailed map of the placement of
 the shooting towers and another critical places. It is necessary to study this map carefully,
 because the detail information will speed up the course of the operation. You will be
 transported to the island by ships that are equipped with an antidetection shield, so
 Penytras will not be able to call the reinforcements from the sea before we will be detected
 by the coastal radars. The time we gain this way should be enough for the realization of the
 mission.
