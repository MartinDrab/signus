#> According to the order we have succeeded to capture Arten and subsequently Sanukor. We are in
 control of these basis and we are expecting next orders.
#> As to the documents about the found artefacts: In Sanukor we have only found the mentions of
 the transportation to more distant base Tortugal in the west of Eutanie. The artefacts from Arten
 were probably transported to the same place.
