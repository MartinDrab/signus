#> Barracuda is a submarine made on the basis of artefact technology. It is equipped
 with a special torpedo-launcher. One of the biggest advantages of these submarines is their
 monitoring system, which enables to see any enemy unit. The disadvantage of these
 weapons is, that they are easily detectable by the Viking destroyers.
#> There has appeared a problem with the overpressured rooms during the development
 of these submarines. Fortunately we succeeded to solve it before there were any distinct
 casualties.
