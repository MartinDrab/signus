#> Mystic is a fight bomber constructed in virtue of the original Arconis technology. It is
 equipped with a launcher of air-air rockets and with a heavy-weight machine-gun. It is also
 equipped with a launcher of air-earth rockets.
#> It is probably the most powerful air force ever. The pilots of Mystic relish it for its
 easy controllability and speed that exceeds even the Ikaroses. And that makes it a very
 dangerous antagonist in the air. It is also very effective for the fight against surface units.
 Its rockets are very dangerous and Mystic usually has enough time to get away from the
 range of enemy flak.
#> Although this machine is not the first that has been developed in virtue of Aroconis
 technology, it is the first one that is considered to be an artefact generation machine
 because of its qualities.
