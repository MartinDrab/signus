#> The investigation station Toricon, the forbidden Zone of Eutanie

#> At about 11.30 P.M. several unprecedented strong vibrations started in the centre of the
 City. During the recognition of damages some surprising events have happened - the
 pyramid started to open  spontaneously and the thunder-like sound was everywhere.
 According to the notation of measuring instruments, it was quite different frequency than
 usual.
#> Some kind of nebula has appeared and surrounded the whole camp. After the first panic
 has fallen of and the analysis showed that this nebula is not dangerous, we decided to step
 into the pyramid. We had to spend there at least several hours, but after the return none of
 us could recall what was happening in those moments. All of us just suddenly felt that we
 are not alone in the City anymore...
