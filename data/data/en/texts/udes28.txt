#> Mohycane is a standard war train. It is armed with a middle-class machine-gun AGON and an
 anti-aircraft machine-gun of a 38mm gauge. It is considerably well armoured and it has a high
 resistance.
#> The biggest power of this unit is its versatility. It is fast, resistant and able to attack the surface
 targets same as the aircraft unions. It was constructed as a supporting unit to the first line. There it
 fearlessly equalizes to tanks. The only weakness of this train (same as of all other trains) is its
 mobility which is limited by the railway. The biggest enemies of this weapons are the miners that
 are able to paralyse whole unions of Mohycanes with only a couple of mines. Therefore we
 recommend to use these units together with Xenons.
