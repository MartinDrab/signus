#> We have been trying to capture the base Taluon for two days already. However it is still
 resistant to our attacks. We have informed Toricon about the present situation and found
 out the only possible solution...
#> The sonic tanks, that are kept in the Toricon's base Tulos several miles from here, are the
 solution.
#> The fastest and also the only suitable way to transport the tanks, is the Tubar bridge. We
 have been keeping this access to Taluon under control until now. But we can suppose that
 the enemy has already estimated our next move and is about to start the concentrated
 attack with a goal to capture or destroy the bridge. Your task is to keep the Taluon's units
 in sufficient distance from the bridge and to unable any effort to detonate Tubar if they got
 too close. We have to keep the bridge under our control at any prize, or we will loose the
 opportunity to use the sonic tanks in the following breaching of the defensive barrage of
 Taluon. We know it and they know it too. So get ready for the worst...

 and capture the Consortium's base - Taluon.
