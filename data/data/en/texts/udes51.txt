#> All bases used by the Signus units are constructed according to the base Mahakam. Each base
 has its operating center where a commander officer (captain) and his three-member team is. They
 are looking after the run of this fully automated base. The supervision is just sporadic because the
 bases are able to work without any human help.
#> The body of the whole base is the so called Hangar with fuel pumps for the war machines,
 dosing machines and the service units. All the machines are charged with the solar batteries placed
 on the top of the base.
#> The basis are equipped with the attachment Seal same as the radars. This equipment
 recognises the enemy units and does not let them inside of the objects. Unfortunately the vehicles
 of investigation Boomerangs are able to break through this Imprint.
