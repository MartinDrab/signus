#> Iris is a service unit created similar to standard army vehicle - Betan 24. It is unarmed and it only has basic armour.
#> In missions, where war machines were forced to operate far away from their bases, was a need of a vehicle that would be able to repair the damaged units so they could return to the heroic fight in the front line. During the creation of Iris,
 big demands were put on its mobility. That has caused its low resistance, which unable it to operate together with the hit units.
#> "Iris has been improved many times and today it almost does not remind us of its predecessor Betan 24. However they still have one thing in common - the effort to help their friends in the fight." - a promotion leaflet distributed among
 the pilots of Iris vehicles.
