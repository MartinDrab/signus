#> The Batix base
#> Resulting situation: the units of Consortium succeeded to spread their soldiers around Batix and
 we are expecting the attack in any minute. The latest and recently tested weapons are stored in
 Batix. It is also used as a stock of usual ammunition and arsenal for the hit units.
#> According to the situation we cannot afford capitulation.
#> Your task is to hold the fortress until the arrival of the reinforcements. If you fail, Consortium
 gains another stronger weapon against Toricon.
#> Unfortunately, we cannot use these weapons for the defence because Toricon demands absolute
 concealment. If we get defeated the weapons and all the notes about their testing have to be
 destroyed.
#> There is nothing else I can tell you about this matter. Nobody knows anything, nobody says
 anything.
